## 🤷‍♀️ What is this?

A place for people who:
- Say “I hate coding” at least 3 times a week
- Ship bugs in production like it's a feature
- Open 10 Stack Overflow tabs and cry in only 7 of them
- Celebrate `npm install` working without 42 warnings

---

## 😵 Why Join?

- 🤡 Laugh through your codebase
- 🧯 Set your repo on fire and call it “feature-driven development”
- 🐛 Worship the sacred bug that no one can fix
- 👀 Lurk or contribute – both are equally chaotic

## 💀 Our Philosophy

> If it works, don’t touch it.  
> If it doesn’t work, also don’t touch it.  
> Just rename the file and hope for the best.
